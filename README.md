## ðŸš¦ Explanation about plugin structure

### Plugin directories and files:

> The primary plugin file is being located in root directory.
 
In the root directory, you can see these subdirectories:

#### 1. assets
All assets files locates in this directory. For admin assets, I consider a separated directory.
It contains all of CSS, JS and images files which the plugin needs to use them. 

#### 2. includes
All classes related to this plugin is located in this directory. 

#### 3. languages
Files that the plugin needs for internationalization is located in language directory.

#### 4. logs
For many reasons, we need to log some processes like errors or doing repeating tasks.
For this reason, I decided to have a separeted directory. 

#### 5. templates
For separating view part, I use template directory. So if I need to render any HTML files in front end or back end, I ues this directory.
